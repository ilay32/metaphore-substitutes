## Metaphoric Verb Substitutes
This code is not meant for general use. Besides all the python dependancies,
it requires access to some databases that are not open for public use.

* Object: Given an abstract, non-literal use of a verb, find a suitable literal substitute.

* Python 3

* Required Python modules: nltk,pandas,scipy,numpy (some others too, but these are the
heavy, non-built in ones).
